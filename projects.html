               <a target="_blank" href="https://battlecode.org/">Battlecode</a> is an MIT programming strategy competition where teams develop software to 
               control a team of virtual robots in a new game every year.
               <br><br>
               In 2025, our team competed in MIT as a finalist in the fog of war, turf wars game, placing 13th out of 127 college teams across the U.S. 
               One particularly interesting component of our strategy was communication, where we had limited instructions, bits, and range to send as 
               much pertinent as we could. For this, we created an bit encoding scheme and what we called the "robot internet", where we relayed messages
               between each agent to solve range issues and built upon the bits from each relay iteration to construct more detailed reports.
               <br><br>
               Using this information containing enemy information, locations of interest, and more, we could then enact more complicated macro-level 
               strategies where we could organize our robots to retreat and defend or gather forces in particular areas we deemed more vulnerable.
               <br><br>
               We also competed in 2024, when the game was capture the flag, placing 19th out of 115 U.S. college teams.

                The <a href="https://calico.cs.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank">CALICO Informatics Competition</a> is an international programming competition
                I have participated in bi-annualy. Teams are presented with a set of problems of varying difficulty, and are awarded points for correct answers that
                are both earlier and took less submissions to reach.
                <br><br>
                Our team of three divies up our problems according to our strengths and weaknesses, priotizing which tasks we think will yield the most
                points and reward with respect to the time we estimate they'll take. Of course, at the end of the day, it's a great deal of fun working in our team
                that has grown closer over time.
                <br><br>
                In Fall 2025, we placed in the top 8% (85th/1092 entrants), achieving a silver medal.<br>
                In Spring 2024, we placed in the top 10% (81st/920 entrants), also achieving a silver medal.

                A home-cooked Java implementation  of RSA encryption. I created this shortly after taking cryptography class that covered these sorts of topics, as 
                it went moreso into the math rather than the programming aspects, so I was curious to see what kinds of challenges may appear when put into practice, 
                and I took this as an opportunity to look deeper into concepts I had learned.
                <br><br>
                This project includes programs to encrypt and then decrypt a message across a public channel. Implementation-wise, I implemented the RSA algorithm,
                an algorithm to generate appropriately large random primes, and the Miller-Rabin primality test. Along the way, I used many optimizations such as memoizations
                needed to smoothen out the processing time with such large numbers.

                An online, educational quiz game intended to teach students trivia about the U.S. states. Includes various question modes, a timer, and a leaderboard
                to foster a competetive spirit and create fun, learning experience.
                <br><br>
                Collaborated with a team of four others, going through Agile motions and exercising practices in version control, code review, CI testing, and more.
                This project was a great opportunity to grow myself as a programmer who is more open and communicative with unfamiliar teammates, and is better at understanding
                how to lead and best create shared understanding among us.
